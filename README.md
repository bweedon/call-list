# TODO
- [ ] Unique phone number to prevent duplicates
- [ ] Make email address a unique constraint?
- [ ] Don't store creds in a public repo
- [ ] Make a user for the app to use, don't use the sa account.
- [ ] I don't like that the PhoneType of the db and dto overlap, but don't see a reason to duplicate a class for no reason other than smell.
